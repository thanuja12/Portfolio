    <div class="row">

        <div class="column left">
            <p>I have over 6 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked at both small startups and
                large organizations. While I'm a proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is in building scalable
                backend services (API services, stream processing, and async mechanisms).</p>

            <p> I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, I'm most
                attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification. I'm looking for a senior
                individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative team leadership responsibilites, and
                gain experience with architecture and project management.</p>

                My personal interests include:

                <li>Deep learning. It's an exciting time for machine learning. I'm working through several online
                    classes, and swap articles with collegues.</li>

                <li>RC Planes and Boats. I've been an enthusiastic hobbiest since I was a teenager - but only as an
                    adult am I able to afford the higher-quality devices. I like to modify existing kits to improve
                    speed, and add instrumentation.</li>

                <li> Mountaineering. I live in the Pacific Northwest, home of some of the greatest mountains and trails
                    in the country. I enjoy spending weekends on scrambles and getting lost in the woods.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li> OpenGidget is an open-source fork of Raspbian Linux that makes it easier to auto-provision a
                    headless Raspberry PI, get it onto your WiFi network, and deploy simple Python and Ruby scripts that
                    run at startup - all without needing to plug in a keyboard/monitor.
                </li>
                <li>My Medium blog covers my ongoing attempts to instrument and automate everything in my house.
